def: "A dependent continuant that inheres in a bearer (plant anatomical entity) by virtue of how the bearer is related to other entities. An attribute or value of a plant or plant part." [RW:test]
comment: Attributes are generalized or abstract qualities (size, shape, color) while values are specific types of an attribute that can inhere in an individual (large, square, red). This ontology branch includes both attributes and values, because values are subtypes of attributes. This definition is based on PATO's definition of the root term quality (PATO:0000001). Cross references for mapping to Trait Ontology terms are provided where appropriate. Many of these terms could be defined using cross products between PATO and PO. It is not yet clear if these qualties can inhere in plant development stages as well as plant anatomical entities.

Does not include functional or physiological qualities. Presence or absence of a plant structure or plant structure feature is a plant structure count quality.

comment: These qualities are taken from the Manual of Leaf Architecture by Ellis et al. Qualities that describe the presence, absence, or count of a part of a leaf are subtypes of  plant structure count (PO:0032113). Some leaf morphology qualities, such as leaf vasculature quality or petiole feature, will only apply to vascular leaves.
